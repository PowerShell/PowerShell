# Working Group Definitions

This document serves to be a web readable interface for the list of the current PowerShell [Working Groups (WG)](working-group.md),
as well as their definitions, membership, and a non-exhaustive set of examples of topics that fall
within the purview of that WG.

The list is maintained in the [following json file](working-groups.json) and as part of repository documentation updates, this document is autogenerated when changes to the definition file occurs.

For an up-to-date list of the issue/PR labels associated with these WGs,
see [Issue Management](../maintainers/issue-management.md)
