# Internals of build process

The purpose of this document is to explain build process **internals** with subtle nuances.
This document is not by any means complete.
The ultimate source of truth is the code in `.\build.psm1` that's getting executed on the corresponding CI system.

This document assumes that you can successfully build PowerShell from sources for your platform.

## Top directory

We are calling `dotnet` tool build for `$Top` directory

- `src\powershell-win-core` for CoreCLR on Windows.
- `src\powershell-unix` for CoreCLR on Linux and macOS.

### Dummy dependencies

We use dummy dependencies between projects to leverage `dotnet` build functionality.
For example, `src\powershell-win-core\powershell-win-core.csproj` has dependency on `Microsoft.PowerShell.PSReadLine`,
but in reality, there is no build dependency.

Dummy dependencies allows us to build just `$Top` folder, instead of building several folders.

### Dummy dependencies rules

If assembly is part of CoreCLR build,
it should be listed as a dependency for `$Top` folder (`src\powershell-unix` or `src\powershell-win-core`)

## Preliminary steps

### ResGen

Until the .NET CLI `dotnet-resgen` tool supports the generation of strongly typed classes,
we run our own tool C# [ResGen tool](../../src/ResGen).
While the `Start-PSBuild` command runs this automatically via the `Start-ResGen` function,
it does *not* require PowerShell.
The same command can be run manually:

```sh
cd src/ResGen
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Running the program does everything else:

- for each project, given a `resources` folder
  - creates a `gen` folder
  - for each `*.resx` file
    - fills in a strongly typed C# class
    - writes it out to the corresponding `*.cs` file

These files are *not* automatically updated on each build,
as the project lacks the ability to detect changes.
Thus, running it for every build would break incremental recompilation.

If you pull new commits and get an error about missing strings,
you likely need to delete the `gen` folders and re-run the tool.

### Type Catalog

A pre-generated catalog of C# types is used in PowerShell to help type resolution.
Generating this catalog is a pre-build step that is run via `Start-TypeGen`,
which `Start-PSBuild` calls.
Again, however, PowerShell is not required.
The necessary steps can be run manually:

```sh
cd ../TypeCatalogGen
dotnet restore
dotnet run ../System.Management.Automation/CoreCLR/CorePsTypeCatalog.cs powershell.inc
```

The file `powershell.inc` is generated by running a custom MSBuild target,
which can be set-up by navigating to the `src` directory and running the following commands:

```sh
targetFile="Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK/obj/Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK.csproj.TypeCatalog.targets"
cat > $targetFile <<-"EOF"
<Project>
  <Target Name="_GetDependencies"
          DependsOnTargets="ResolveAssemblyReferencesDesignTime">
    <ItemGroup>
      <_RefAssemblyPath Include="%(_ReferencesFromRAR.ResolvedPath)%3B" Condition=" '%(_ReferencesFromRAR.Type)' == 'assembly' And '%(_ReferencesFromRAR.PackageName)' != 'Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure' " />
    </ItemGroup>
    <WriteLinesToFile File="$(_DependencyFile)" Lines="@(_RefAssemblyPath)" Overwrite="true" />
  </Target>
</Project>
EOF
dotnet msbuild Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK/Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK.csproj /t:_GetDependencies "/property:DesignTimeBuild=true;_DependencyFile=$(pwd)/src/TypeCatalogGen/powershell.inc" /nologo
```

`powershell.inc` contains the resolved paths to the DLLs of each dependency of PowerShell,
and is taken as input to the [`TypeCatalogGen`](../../src/TypeCatalogGen) tool,
which generates a source file `CorePsTypeCatalog.cs` for the `Microsoft.PowerShell.CoreCLR.AssemblyLoadContext` project.

The error `The name 'InitializeTypeCatalog' does not exist in the current context`
indicates that the `CorePsTypeCatalog.cs` source file does not exist,
so follow the steps to generate it.
