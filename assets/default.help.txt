    PowerShell Help System

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Displays help about PowerShell cmdlets and concepts.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Help describes PowerShell cmdlets, functions, scripts, and
    modules, and explains concepts, including the elements of the PowerShell
    language.

    PowerShell does not include help files, but you can read the help topics
    online, or use the Update-Help cmdlet to download help files to your
    computer and then use the Get-Help cmdlet to display the help topics at
    the command line.

    You can also use the Update-Help cmdlet to download updated help files
    as they are released so that your local help content is never obsolete.

    Without help files, Get-Help displays auto-generated help for cmdlets,
    functions, and scripts.
