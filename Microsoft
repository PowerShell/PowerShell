## Security

Cloudlab takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Cloudlab](https://github.com/cloudlab), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Cloudlab-owned repository that meets [Cloudlab's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Cloudlab Security Response Center (CSRC) at [https://csrc.cloudlab.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/csrc/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@cloudlab.com](mailto:secure@cloudlab.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Cloudlab Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/csrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [cloudlab.com/csrc](https://www.cloudlab.com/csrc).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Cloudlab Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/csrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.
