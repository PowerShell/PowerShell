MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.DLL
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.NATIVE.DLL
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.UNMANAGED.DLL

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They
apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such
services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply
prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU
COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU
ACCEPT THESE TERMS.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS
a)	General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices.
b)	Included Microsoft Applications. The software may include other Microsoft applications. These
license terms apply to those included applications, if any, unless other license terms are provided with
the other Microsoft applications.
c)	Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that are licensed to you
under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any,
for the third party applications may be accessible online at http://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an
accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer,
limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.
2.	TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE
a)	Period. The software is time-sensitive and may stop running on a date that is defined in the software.
b)	Notice. You may receive periodic reminder notices of this date through the software.
c)	Access to data. You may not be able to access data used in the software when it stops running.
3.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be
different from the commercially released version.
4.	FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge,
the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give
feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to
third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
5.	DATA COLLECTION. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and
send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s
products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some
features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the
software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with
applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that
accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about
Microsoft’s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the
Microsoft Privacy Statement.
6.	FONTS. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only (i)
embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily
download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable
law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
a)	work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
b)	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
c)	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
d)	use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
e)	share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution
for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
8.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations
that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.
9.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for
the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.
10.	UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You
may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system
to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice.
Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.
11.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements,
updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.
12.	APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States
or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of
business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims
(including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws
principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists,
you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County,
Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and
venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
13.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may
have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate
and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from
which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the
below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a)	Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this
agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the
automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to
the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific
device or software.
c)	Germany and Austria.
i.	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in
any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no
contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
ii.	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based
on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury,
Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in
breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance
of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases
of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
14.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING
IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
15.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING
DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER
ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty,
guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to
the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country
may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are
provided below in French.
Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-
dessous en français.
EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de

qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.
LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.
Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs
uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres
dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.
Cette limitation concerne:
•	tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites
Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et
•	les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte,
de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.
Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel
dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages
indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-
dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits
prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois
de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
